# ml-exploration
A repository to store my notes / explorations in applied machine learning. Some major projects within the repo include:
1. **kaggle-titanic**: My exploration and modeling around the Titanic kaggle competition
2. **tree-model-notes**: Notes I put together around how tree-based machine learning models work.
